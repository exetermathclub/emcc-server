                    The Exeter Math Club Competition (EMC<sup>2</sup>) is a middle-school math competition held at Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire.
                </p>
                <p>
                    EMC<sup>2</sup> is an excellent opportunity for young aspiring mathematicians to develop their mathematical talents, get tournament experience, bond with their friends, and connect with other students from different schools. The tournament is being run mostly by Exeter Math Club students, but with some help from our teachers. Most of us have participated in math contests in middle school and all of us participate in high school contests. We've tried to incorporate some of our favorite parts of those competitions into EMC<sup>2</sup>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The tournament consists of two individual rounds (speed and accuracy), a team round, and a "guts" round. Students are given 20 minutes to solve 20 questions in the first round and 30 minutes for 10 questions in the second round. The team round is a 45 minute round in which all four team members work together to solve 10 questions. The guts round is a fun and exciting addition to regular written rounds. It is a fast-paced, 75-minute-long team round where 24 problems are given in sets of three, one set at a time for the team to solve together. Teams may spend as much time as they like on each set, and can submit the set to a grader whenever they wish to receive a new set of problems. Teams may not return to a set after having submitted it, as grading occurs immediately after a team has turned in a set of problems. For additional information about the tournament's format, please click <a href="contest_information.shtml#Format">here</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Teams should consist of 4 students in the 8th grade or below, with one coach or other chaperone per team. Teams representing a single school should not have students from outside that school. Each school may now enter as many teams as they wish. Individual students or aggregate teams can also enter, and we will sort them into teams of four ourselves. The cost for a full team is $50, and $15 for individual entries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    EMC<sup>2</sup> is open to traveling teams from outside the local region; as a result, last year we had over 180 students, with teams from far-flung places including China and Illinois and the numbers keep increasing. This year too, we're looking to keep the competition open for any teams willing to travel. Teams would be able to leave for home Saturday afternoon by 4:00 (we have finished on or ahead of schedule in past years), and we will work to provide transportation to the airport if needed.)
